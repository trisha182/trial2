<h1><img src="gunguide.png" alt="logo" width="400" height="300"></h1>

<p> There are 4 categories of apex guns which are light, heavy, energy, and sniper weapons. 
 This page provides will prvide a weapon summary on all you need to know about the guns in Apex Legends.</p>
 <body>
<h1>Light Weapons</h1>

<h2>R-301</h2>
<p>Given that it is one of my personal favorites, this Armory classic will never let you down. The R-301
Carbine has a high fire rate, uses little ammunition, and has relatively tolerable recoil, all of which
contribute to good DPS overall. Its low damage per shot balances out these advantages.
It causes 28 headshot damage and 14 body damage.
Due to its high DPS, the R-301 is a fantastic mid-range assault rifle that can also be used up close.
Additionally, the R-301's ability to switch between full-auto and semi-auto can make it a long-range
weapon provided you can obtain a suitable scope. But a less significant one. My opinion on this one may
be a little skewed because R-301 is one of my personal favorite guns to use.
</p>

<h2>Alternator</h2>
<p>A wonderful weapon for moving while shooting is the alternator. Alternator is a nice starting weapon
until you discover a better alternative or suitable upgrades because of its 16 body and 24 headshot
damage and mid to low DPS. On the other hand, its care package version includes all the enhancements
and transforms Alternator into a fantastic close-range shredder and a solid mid-range bruiser.</p>

<h2>R-99</h2>
<p>The R-99 is a fantastic close-range shredder with modest damage and high fire rate that is compensated
by its low DPS. Use it carefully because it has an 11 body and 17 headshot damage rating. R-99 has little
to no effect at mid- to long-range, although it can be extremely lethal there. Controlling the spread
becomes a challenge, particularly at long range.
R99 fires more frequently than Devotion, a weapon most known for shooting frequently for extended
periods of time.</p>

<h2>G7-SCOUT</h2>
 <p>The standard infantry weapon for IMC soldiers is the G7 Scout. It was once a sniper rifle, thus it still has
excellent long-range accuracy and only requires small amounts of ammo. G7 is a powerful weapon that
deals 34 body damage and 60 headshot damage, but is relatively challenging to use up close. If you plan
to use G7 for mid to long range, make sure you have a solid close-range weapon.
The G7 in Apex Legends has 10 less rounds in each magazine. The Apex Game&#39; on-the-go upgrade
mechanism, however, allows it to be increased to 20 per magazine.</p>

<h2>SPITFIRE</h2>
<p>I&#39;m pleased to introduce to you the M600 Spitfire: inventor of LMGs, slayer of infantry, shatterer of
shields, purported guardian of immigrants, and divider of communities.
The weapon of suppressive fire is the Spitfire. Everything is present. High damage, reasonable recoil,
plenty of ammo, and strong DPS. Spitfire&#39;s suppressive qualities allowed it to survive numerous attempts
by Respawn to weaken this God-of-a-gun.</p>
<p>After yet another nerf, the Spitfire now fires light ammunition instead than the heavy it originally did. It
can hold 50 rounds in its magazine, doesn&#39;t need any upgrades to be effective, and does a fantastic 18
body damage and 27 headshot damage. A fairly respectable rate of fire and a respectably high DPS were
maintained throughout. At close and medium ranges, it is among the most potent weapons.
The replicater is the location where you can use craft material you gathered around the map, to craft a
Spitfire.</p>

<h1>HEAVY WEAPONS</h1>
<h2>VK-47 Flatline</h2>
<p>It has two shooting modes, semi-auto and full-auto, and fires heavy ammunition. For mid-range fighting,
Flatline is a fantastic alternative to the R-301. Its DPS is low because of its slower fire rate, which may
not be useful in long distance battles. Regardless of its low DPS this gun is still one of my favorites as, it
is my go to gun when I can’t find an R-301 or just want to take a break from the R-301.
Flatline possesses a good 19 body damage and 33 headshot damage which both greater than R-301.</p>

<h2>Prowler</h2>
<p>Personal Defense with Prowler Burst The weapon&#39;s close-to-midrange DPS is really the greatest of all
SMGs. However, because of its burst-fire function, it is more difficult to manage and does not let you to
continuously fire on adversaries. It fires heavy ammunition that deals 23 headshot and 15 body shot
damage. Due to the spread, using a burst-fire SMG at a great distance is typically exceedingly
challenging.</p>

<h2>HEMLOK</h2>
<p>Hemlok is a mid-to-long range assault rifle with a semi-automatic and three-round burst firing mode.
While burst fire is more efficient at near to mid-range, long-range weapons can also be utilized in single-
shot mode in an emergency.</p>
<p>Hemlok deals 20 body and 35 headshot damage.</p>
<p>Hemlok employs heavy ammunition and has a respectable ammo capacity of up to 30 bullets. Hemlok is
typically not regarded as a beginner-friendly weapon because it is an assault rifle without a full-auto
mode. It&#39;s challenging to get it function consistently, but when it does, it&#39;s amazing. To use Hemlok
effectively, you&#39;ll need to improve your accuracy metrics, so if you still need more practice, the Firing
Range and G-Loot are your best friends.</p>

<h2>RAMPAGE</h2>
<p>Rampage has an amazing 42 headshot damage and 28 body damage. Rampage&#39;s relatively low fire rate
can be increased using a thermite grenade by using heavy ammunition. similar to using a Shield Cell to
strengthen a Sentinel.</p>
<p>Rampage has a modest fire rate, but it makes up for it with extremely high damage, lots of ammo, and
tolerable recoil. Due of its minimal recoil, it is extremely useful from a distance, particularly if you are
out of alternatives. Remember that Rampage probably won&#39;t be able to hold its own against a legitimate
sniper rifle. </p>
<p>Rampage&#39;s enhanced mode will also cause your shots to smash through doors, so be careful when using
your boost to go past your adversaries&#39; defenses.</p>
<p> This is by far my favorite heavy weapon through out Apex Legends because its so lethal. This gun hits
HARD. As it only takes a few bullets to knock out individual enemies, which is why they made this gun a
rare drop, meaning you can only get it out of random care packages that the game drops around the
map.</p>

<h2>30-30 REAPTOR</h2>
<p>30-30 Repeater is a recent addition to the Apex Legends arsenal. It is a single-shot repeater that shoots
powerful ammo. When you aim down sights, the 30-30 Repeater progressively charges up, increasing
the damage of your subsequent fire. Although this reduces its rate of fire, the damage more than makes
up for it. The lethal 42 to 57 body damage and 74 to 100 head damage of the 30-30 Repeater are the
charged versions of their respective damage types. The 30-30 Repeater&#39;s charged damage values even
compete with some of the game&#39;s sniper weapons.</p>
<p>The 30-30 Repeater will definitely give you trouble up close because it fires only one shot at a slow rate.
The Shatter Caps improvement can fix this. It resembles a weak shotgun, but it transforms 30-30 into
one. most often an urgent upgrade.</p>
<p> Mid to long-range shooting is where 30-30 works best, especially if you can charge up your rounds. But
because it cannot be equipped with sniper sights, it is only a poor alternative for a sniper rifle at a
distance.</p>

<h2>C.A.R</h2>
<p>The fifth SMG to be included in Apex Legends is the CAR (Combat Advanced Round) SMG, which stands
    out from the others because to its versatility. The new weapon added to the arsenal in Season 11 has
    the unusual ability to switch between Heavy and Light ammo, providing you far more leeway than with
    other similar weapons when it comes to ammo reserves and inventory management. Shots fired with
    either heavy or light ammunition have comparable damage, fire rate, ballistics, graphics, and audio
    characteristics.</p>
<p>The CAR appears to be a highly powerful SMG overall, with a very high fire rate (albeit not quite as quick
    as the R-99) and fair to good damage as well. Together, these factors make the CAR SMG, excluding the
    Devotion (and Rampart&#39;s Minigun, if you want to be petty about it), the full-auto weapon in the game
    with the most damage-per-second. The drawback is that you&#39;ll have to deal with very powerful side-to-
    side recoil, therefore the CAR really needs a barrel stabilizer.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CAR&#39;s Mag attachment slot may accept either a Heavy or a Light Extended Magazine.
    You are not limited to using only one type of ammo because they function identically; you can still swap
    between heavy and light ammo on the battlefield. My person opinion about this gun, is that it is a great
    gun that gives you diversity when it comes to ammo. I would say it surpasses the R-99 but that today is
    stilled being argued.</p>

<h1>ENERGY WEAPONS</h1>
<h2>HAVOC</h2>
<p>Before launching energy ammo in the form of bullets towards the other Legends, the HAVOC must be
 wound up. It has a higher body DPS than the R-301, but a lower headshot DPS. It deals 18 body and 32 headshot damage.</p>

<p>HAVOC&#39;s recoil was purposefully made unpredictable in order to counteract its massive stopping power
    at practically mid-range. A turbocharger (an add on) is also necessary for the HAVOC to function in close
    quarters; without one, you will typically have to wait in line for another battle during the wind-up
    period.</p>

<h2>Devotion</h2>
<p>The Devotion is such a weak weapon that you better hope you have an R-99 or similar weapon to
    counter it the moment you see an attacker bring it out. One of the best close to mid-range obliterators
    you can find is the Devotion LMG. It has a tremendously high fire rate, second only to R-99&#39;s insane
    bullet storm, and it has a 16 body and 32 headshot damage rating. Devotion is special because of the
    way it gradually increases to a high fire rate. The more you keep the trigger squeezed, the faster it
    grows, but it starts out extremely slowly.</p>
<p>Devotion becomes a beast that uses energy ammunition when the large magazine is factored into the
    equation. This gun is also compatible with the add on: Turbo charger. Adding on the turbo charger helps
    speed up the wind up time which makes this gun even more deadly since it has a high bullet release
    rate.</p>

<h2>L-STAR</h2>
<p>Since it doesn&#39;t utilize a magazine and instead warms up as you shoot, it stands out among the other
    weapons in the Apex Legends arsenal. Instead of reloading as it reaches its maximum heat, you must let
    it to cool. At any heat setting, pressing the reload button will expedite this process.</p>

<p>L-STAR discharges a string of red plasma spheres while using energy munitions. Since there is no
    magazine, it gets the ammunition directly from your inventory. L-STAR may be fired indefinitely as long
    as the temperature is kept low and you have energy ammo on hand.</p>

<p>L-STAR deals 32 headshot and 18 body shot damage.</p>
<p>Its special benefits in battle make it a fantastic close-to-midrange weapon. The large red plasma spheres
    that it fires are one illustration of this. They occupy a lot of room and considerably obstruct the vision of
    your adversaries. Keep in mind that if not used appropriately, these orbs might potentially obscure your
    eyesight. Additionally, firing in short bursts will reduce the likelihood that your L-STAR may overheat.</p>

<h2>Volt</h2>
<p>Volt joined the Apex Legends late, but he left a lasting effect. Its built-in digital sight makes it an
    excellent beginner weapon because it eliminates the need for additional scope attachments to facilitate
    aiming. Volt uses energy ammunition, dealing 23 headshot and 15 body damage. Bolts of focused
    energy are fired by Volt.</p>

<p>The Volt is a fine beginner weapon, but because of its limited magazine size, it is significantly more
    difficult to utilize at close range. It releases energy shots that create a highly clear trail that will let
    adversaries know where you are.</p>

    <h1>SNIPER GUNS</h1>
<h2>TRIPLE TAKE</h2>
<p>The Triple Take boosts your likelihood of striking targets at the expense of damage and fire rate. The
    Triple Take ups the ante by adding a third barrel and shooting three shots each time you fire, while the
    Double Take fires two shots simultaneously.</p>
<p>It fires projectiles that do 23 body and 46 headshot damage each and utilizes energy ammo, therefore
    the more projectiles you can manage to strike a foe with, the more damage you will deal. With the
    switchable Choke upgrade included with the Triple Take, you can choke your projectiles together for a
    more concentrated shot that can hit a target several times. Only aiming down will activate the choke
    improvement.</p>

<h2>Bocek Compound Bow</h2>
<p>Bocek is one of the newest weapons in the Apex series, and it uses arrows as its own special
    ammunition. The Bocek doesn&#39;t need to be reloaded and draws ammunition directly from your stock.
    The Bocek is special in that the arrows you fire can be collected as long as you don&#39;t utilize the Shatter
    Caps upgrade. Missed your objective? Your arrow can be picked up by simply walking over it or by
    selecting it using the interact button. When enemies been by your bows, you can collect those arrows
    used in the enemies deathbox.</p>
<p>By holding down the fire button, you can draw your bow. The amount of damage will depend on when
    you actually discharge the shot. The longer you draw Bocek, the more damage it does as well. You can
    completely draw each shot for powerful but slower damage, or you can fire instantaneously for a
    quicker fire rate at the expense of damage. The Tempo enhancement for Deadeye greatly increases the shooting rate.</p>
<p>An astounding 25 to 60 body and 31 to 105 headshot damage are dealt by Bocek, with the greater
    values coming from rounds fired while fully drawn. To be effective at close range and flash the brightest
    at mid to long range, it heavily depends on the Shatter Caps upgrade.</p>
<h2>CHARGE RIFFLE</h2>

<p>Now time for my number 1 favorite sniper that is my baby in the game, the charge riffle. This devil of a
    weapon is an annoying but beast of a weapon. Which is quite crazy how they have not nerfed this gun
    yet, which I hope they don&#39;t because that&#39;s my baby. Its fires sniper ammo, and a fully loaded magazine
    can fire 4 bullets while consuming 8 sniper ammo.</p>
<p>There is no maximum range for the Charge Rifle. It can fire a long-range beam and always follows that
    up with an accurate shot, meaning that you can be across the map and still get sniped. To counteract
    this, Charge Rifle&#39;s damage is lowered beyond 150 meters and it has a severe recoil during the build-up
    phase of shooting. It causes devastating 90 damage to the body and 116 damage to the head if you
    manage to hit both the build-up beam and the final beam. The fact that leg shots with this weapon do
    not incur a damage penalty, unlike shots with other weapons, is another benefit. So definitely give this
    gun a try.</p>

<h2>Longbow DMR</h2>
<p>Ironically, the Apex Legends Longbow DMR, also known as the Designated Marksman Rifle, is a sniper
    rifle. Most importantly, it is a semi-automatic rifle that employs sniper ammunition. Without barely
    leaving the scope-sight, the longbow may fire back-to-back shots, but at the expense of damage.
    Longbow DMR damage is 60 body and 129 headshot wounds. If you are in the right location and
    combine the Longbow&#39;s somewhat higher fire rate, it can become incredibly lethal.
    Longbow, the only semi-auto sniper rifle, has the largest magazine capacity of any sniper rifle. Naturally,
    this is counterbalanced by its strong recoil and subpar hip-fire accuracy. Additionally, the bullets from a
    longbow move more slowly and are more susceptible to gravity. It works well at medium to long range
    and is an excellent mid-game weapon. It is challenging to use at the endgame because you can&#39;t merely
    position yourself at a wide viewpoint, and it has poor hip accuracy. I personally dislike this gun cause it’s
    the bullets curves downwards when it comes to long range shots, meaning that the accuracy lessons.
    But aye, wants you know how to handle this gun and along with knowing how to work with its accuracy,
    you become a monster.</p>

<h2>Sentinel ESR</h2>

<p>This bolt-action beast literally eats shields. Due to its bolt-action design, the Sentinel Electromagnetic
    Sniper Rifle fires slowly and utilizes sniper ammunition. yet its massive damage and capacity for
    supercharging more than make up for it. It performs well at medium to long ranges, like other sniper
    rifles.</p>
<p>You can increase this beasts damage output by feeding it two shield cells. When Sentinel is amplified, it
    deals 88 body and 176 headshot damage in addition to its normal 70 body and 140 headshot damage.
    Sentinel&#39;s slow fire rate is one of its main drawbacks, however it can be fixed with the Deadeye&#39;s Tempo
    upgrade if you can time your bullets correctly.
    </p>
<h2>Kraber .50-Cal Sniper</h2>

<p>Here we are at the Spitfire-Kraber opposite end of the spectrum. The real Devils weapon in Apex
    Legends. The Kraber is the ideal sniper weapon. Kraber is always a care package weapon because of how
    powerful it is; you will never discover it as ground loot. It has 12 shots, each of which deals a devastating
    435 headshot and 145 body damage. Even with a full red shield (225 HP), a Kraber headshot can bring
    down a fortified target (Caustic, Gibraltar) wearing a tier 3 or 4 helmet because Kraber&#39;s headshot
    damage can only be reduced down to 247.</p>
<p>A well-placed Kraber shot can quickly take out an attacker. The Kraber is a rare weapon that requires
    careful application because Apex Legends is a Battle Royale game.</p>
<p>Although Kraber has a 4-10x Digital Threat Scope, you are required to zoom out after each shot. Its
    slowest rate of fire in the game and the lengthiest animations are balance precautions meant to stop
    you from instantly killing whole teams. It may pierce through foes to cause collateral damage, just as
    other sniper rifles. With Kraber, a well-placed single bullet can even take out many enemies at once. To
    give a quick tip on using this gun because you are only limited to 12 shots, you better make every bullet
    count. If you so happen to find one in a care package and you don’t want to take, I recommend you
    hiding the gun somewhere so an enemy doesn’t take it.
    </p>
<h1>Shotguns</h1>
<h2>EVA-8 Auto</h2>
<p>Extra-Vehicular Activity Automatic Shotgun, or EVA-8, has a high rate of fire and does respectable
    damage. It fires nine pellets every shot with shotgun ammunition, each of which deals seven body
    wounds and eleven head wounds. Additionally, it doesn&#39;t take a hit penalty from leg shots, increasing its
    DPS.</p>

<p>The EVA-8 Auto is a fantastic close-range stopper that loads shells into a magazine as opposed to
    individually. This allows you to quickly fire a succession of single 9-pellet bullets by eliminating the need
    to chamber each shot. EVA-8 provides a rapid, high DPS answer to your survival issue and truly excels in
    cramped spaces. Considering that aiming down sights doesn&#39;t bind the pellets together, it also boasts
    respectable hipshot performance.</p>

<h2>Mastiff</h2>
<p>Instead of a squared pellet distribution, Mastiff provides a horizontal one. The majority of pellets hit the
    target when they are aimed at the target&#39;s chest region. With down sights, the pellets are also
    compressed closer together for greater accuracy.</p>
<p>Mastiff fires a shotgun, dealing damage of 11x8 to the torso and 14x8 to the head with no penalty for
    hitting the legs. Of course, it&#39;s not simple to find an adversary whose skull is large enough to take all
    eight of your horizontal pellets. Mastiff compensates for this by allowing you to load each shot
    individually, allowing you to reload between shots without using up your full magazine.</p>

<h2>Peacekeeper</h2>
<p>The energy shotgun Peacekeeper uses shotgun ammunition and does powerful 9x11 body and 11x11
    headshot damage. This lever-action monster, with its oddly titled name, has a powerful punch when
    used up close. Peacekeeper still makes a terrific finisher against a target you&#39;ve previously dealt some
    damage to, but its relatively modest fire rate balances the damage output.</p>
<p>You may bring the pellets even closer together for optimal precision with Peacekeeper&#39;s built-in
    modification to the choke. It performs well when fired from the hip and is a good emergency weapon.</p>

<h2>MOZAMBIQUE</h2>
<p>The Mozambique is a respectable sidearm shotgun that fires three triangular pellets every shot. The
    Mozambique Drill, which entails two bullets to the chest and one to the head, is referenced by this
    shape as well as the name of the weapon.</p>
<p>Using shotgun ammunition, Mozambique deals 15x3 body and 22.5x3 headshot damage. Due to its low
    damage per shot and poor DPS, Mozambique has become a meme among the Apex Legends community
    to the point where Respawn has acknowledged its status as a meme. Despite this, Mozambique has a
    rapid rate of fire and is a fairly accessible weapon, making it an ideal choice for beginners. Additionally,
    it is free in the arena and works well as a backup in an emergency.</p>

<h1>PISTOLS</h1>
<h2>P2020</h2>
<p>In the Apex Games, the Hammond P2020, a development of the P2011 and P2016 series, returns. A
    dependable sidearm, the P2020 fires light ammo, performs well when fired from the hip, and deals
    respectable damage—18 to the body and 27 to the head. It reloads quickly, has low recoil, and is
    unrestricted in the arena.</p>
<p>The pistol&#39;s semi-auto mode balances all of these, requiring you to click extremely quickly while
    maintaining a solid aim. To be honest, your fists are a better option than P2020 at close quarters, but
    that is just my opinion.</p>

<h2>RE-45 AUTO</h2>
<p>The RE-45 Auto pistol is back in the Apex Games after showcasing its abilities in the Frontier War. It
    deals 12 body and 18 headshot damage while using light ammunition.</p>
<p>The auto pistol RE-45 balances its modest damage and DPS with a quick rate of fire, excellent hip fire
    performance, and extremely tolerable recoil. Although it loses effectiveness in the late game due to low
    DPS, it still makes a fantastic beginner weapon because of how simple it is to use.</p>

<h2>Wingman</h2>
<p>The Wingman pistol makes a comeback in the Apex Games to annihilate everyone at all ranges after B3
    Wingman and the renowned B3 Wingman Elite. The Wingman uses sniper ammo to inflict death on
    enemies and is frequently referred to as a &quot;pro weapon&quot; because of its high damage-low fire rate
    characteristics.</p>
<p>The Wingman is a high-tech revolver that causes stunning 76 headshot damage in addition to 45 body
    damage. Respawn adjusted Wingman&#39;s damage numerous times, resulting in the 76 damage, as a result
    of community discussion about the character&#39;s high damage. Wingman is a skill that takes some time to
    acquire and much longer to perfect, but the rewards are well worth the effort.</p>
